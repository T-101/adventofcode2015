<p>--- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much ---</p>

<p>The elves bought too much eggnog again - 150 liters this time. To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. You take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have containers of size 20, 15, 10, 5, and 5 liters. If you need to store 25 liters, there are four ways to do it:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 and 10
<li>20 and 5 (the first 5)
<li>20 and 5 (the second 5)
<li>15, 5, and 5
</ul>

<p>Filling all containers entirely, how many different combinations of containers can exactly fit all 150 liters of eggnog?</p>
