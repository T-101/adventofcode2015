<h3>Advent 5a</h3>

<p>--- Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---</p>

<p>Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.</p>

<p>A nice string is one with all of the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou.
<li>It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
<li>It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>ugknbfddgicrmopn is nice because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...), a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.
<li>aaa is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
<li>jchzalrnumimnmhp is naughty because it has no double letter.
<li>haegwjzuvuyypxyu is naughty because it contains the string xy.
<li>dvszwmarrgswjxmb is naughty because it contains only one vowel.
</ul>

<p>How many strings are nice?</p>
